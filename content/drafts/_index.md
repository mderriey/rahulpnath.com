title: Drafts
---

For a long time, I have been having my [draft posts in DropBox](https://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/optimizing-octopress-workflow-for-new-posts/#dropbox-integration) and move them over to the git repository once ready to be published. I came across an [interesting post](https://haacked.com/archive/2019/05/24/write-every-day/) that suggested this idea of pushing up draft posts into the git repository as well. [Pushing frequently](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html) is something that is generally recommended in the programming world as well. With writing, this also gives a sense of how a blog post is developed. This might not be of interest to anyone but still is available there for anyone. 

*Some of these posts below have been there since a long time and might never make it over to the Blog section. Comments are turned off intentionally. If you have any feel free to [raise a PR](https://github.com/rahulpnath/rahulpnath.com/pulls) or leave a [tweet](https://twitter.com/rahulpnath)*
