There might be tech [meetup](meetup.com) groups, study groups around you, which is also a good way to get more involved with technology.

Feel free to reach out to me either via comments on this page or through any of the [social networks](http://www.rahulpnath.com/about/) if you need further help. 

Happy Programming!
